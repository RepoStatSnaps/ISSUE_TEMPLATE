        Please provide a the _smallest, complete code snippet_ that Appium's maintainers can run to reproduce the issue ([read more about what this entails](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)).  Failing this, any sort of reproduction steps are better than nothing!

        An easy way to get started is to copy [sample code](https://github.com/appium/appium/tree/master/packages/appium/sample-code) and modify it accordingly.

        If the result is more than a screenful of text _or_ requires multiple files, please:

        - Put it in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and paste the link, _or_
